Functionality
This capstone project uses a Particle Photon 2 microcontroller to control a game and lighting system with four interactive modes: Game, Chill, Party, and Do Not Disturb.
The user navigates and selects modes using a rotary encoder and pushbutton, while a NeoPixel strip provides visual feedback and an OLED displays the current state.
BLE integration with the Bluefruit Connect app allows remote mode selection and live display of the current mode.
